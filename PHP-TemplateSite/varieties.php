		<p > A long black is a style of coffee commonly found in Australia and New Zealand. 
        It is similar to an Americano, but with a stronger aroma and taste. A long black is made 
        by pouring a double-shot of espresso or ristretto over hot water. ... Usually the water is 
        also heated by the espresso machine.
